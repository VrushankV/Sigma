SIGMA

About SIGMA

Sigma is a one stop app where users can integrate searching on google, finding files on local machine but giving voice input. The app takes Voice / Text input query on a desktop application created using Python with tkinter library.  

We attempted to build a QnA machine learning model, on a dataset but, we could not complete it because of the time constraints.

We have used Azure Cognitive Services to convert speech to text.
